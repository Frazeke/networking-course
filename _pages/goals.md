This is a networking class, so the major goal is to get you familiar with **networking principles, how to send data reliabily and securely, and a good understanding of how the Internet works**. Along the way, I want you to gain some valuable computer systems level experience:

- Know how to write a networking program using sockets.

- Get more exposure to Linux.

- Learn how to write a good command-line tool.

- Be familiar with concurrent programming techniques.
