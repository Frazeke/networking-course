## Course Makeup

This course is made up of three major components:

- **Labs**. Labs will generally be due every week on Thursdays. Occassionally, you get an extra week for a lab when you are implementing a new concept.

- **Homeworks**. Homeworks are due every other week on Tuesdays. They will cover information from the lecture and book.

- **Exams**. There are two midterms and a comprehensive final.

 

## Grade Breakdown

| Component | % of Grade |
| --------- | ---------- |

| Homeworks | 15         |
| Midterms  | 25         |
| Final     | 20         |


## Communication

All communication will be done over Slack. Slack is intended to be used for annoucements, questions, and facilitate student communication. If you have a question, ask it on Slack so that everyone can benefit from hearing the question. 

## Attendance and Participation

This is a senior-level class, and I expect senior-level participation. I expect all students to watch every lecture and be engaged in the lecture. Asking and answering questions in class is important. When you are in a lecture, I expect your attention, so students should not be on their phones or doing non-class related things on laptops.
